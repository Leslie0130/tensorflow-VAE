Implementation of the Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) in Tensorflow

While learning about VAEs, I decided to code one up and replicate some results from the paper "Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes" by Kingma et al. to internalize my learning. My implementation is referenced from the papers in the references below. If you find any typos or mistakes in my code, please let me know! I hope that this code will be useful for others who are also trying to learn about VAEs!
